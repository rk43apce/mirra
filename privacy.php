Personal information includes e-mail addresses, user registration data, passwords, external homepages, gender, birth date, interests, hobbies, travel preferences and any other user-specific data.

This information enables MIRRA to improve its sites to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable.

                                Our site's registration form requires users to, along with other information, give us a valid e-mail address. We may use your e-mail addresses from the registration form to inform you of the status of, new membership benefits and features, to let you know of urgent problems on our site, and to present special members-only opportunities to buy products and services that are appropriate to the interests of our community.

The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address. MIRRA sites record IP addresses for the purpose of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on our sites. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. In addition, your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
